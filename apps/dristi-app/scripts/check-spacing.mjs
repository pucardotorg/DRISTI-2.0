/**
 * Enforce the Pucar spacing ladder in product composition.
 *
 * The ladder is `0.5 · 1 · 1.5 · 2 · 2.5 · 3 · 4 · 6 · 8 · 12 · 16`. Anything else —
 * `p-5`, `gap-10`, `mt-7` — is valid Tailwind and therefore invisible to eslint, and
 * `check-tokens` only catches arbitrary raw units (`p-[13px]`), never an off-ladder
 * rung. So the one rule stated in CLAUDE.md, in the always-on DS rule, and again in the
 * ui-designer role was the one rule nothing checked. It drifted, as ungated rules do.
 *
 * Synced DS primitives are excluded for the same reason `check-typography` excludes
 * them: control chrome legitimately uses its own internal steps (`px-5` in button,
 * `gap-5` in field), those values arrive from the DS, and editing them locally would be
 * destroyed by the next `sync:ui` anyway.
 *
 * ## Baseline
 *
 * This gate was introduced against a codebase that already had ~136 off-ladder values
 * spread across areas owned by different people. Failing all of them on day one would
 * have meant one enormous diff touching everybody's work at once — so existing
 * violations are recorded in `spacing-baseline.json` and tolerated.
 *
 * The gate therefore answers one question: *did this change add a new one?* Existing
 * entries get cleaned up per area, by whoever owns that area, on their own schedule.
 * Fixing one is always safe — the gate reports a shrunken baseline as good news and
 * tells you to re-run with `--update`.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-spacing.mjs             # check
 *   node scripts/check-spacing.mjs --update    # re-record the baseline
