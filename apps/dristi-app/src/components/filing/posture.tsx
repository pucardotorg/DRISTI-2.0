/**
 * Correction posture — the e-filing form, re-entered after a scrutiny return.
 *
 * The screen that clears a scrutiny return *is* this form (brief D2): same steps, same
 * section components, same validation. Only the posture of each field changes — locked
 * (the officer did not flag it), flagged, or resolved. So rather than forking ten section
 * components into a "defects only" mini-form, the sections opt in here:
 *
 *   · `FormField name="ifsc"` says which key a field writes, so a defect can find it.
 *   · `<CorrectionInstance value={i}>` says which cheque / complainant is on screen.
 *   · `useCorrectionInstanceRequest` lets the queue drive the section's own tab state.
 *
 * Outside a correction the context is `null` and every hook here is a no-op, so the
 * ordinary filing flow renders exactly as it did.
 *
 * The frame that wraps a flagged field is *supplied* by the correction screen rather
 * than imported: this module stays a contract between the two, and the filing components
 * never learn what a scrutiny queue looks like.
