/**
 * Who is on this case, and how they are attached to each other.
 *
 * Three populations, deliberately kept apart, and each one browsable in its
 * own right:
 *
 * - **Litigants** — the people and entities the case is between. Where the
 *   drawer is a company, the company *and* every person in charge of and
 *   responsible to it are accused (actors.md, company liability), so a §141
 *   accused is an entity litigant plus one litigant per officer — not one
 *   party carrying a list of officers.
 * - **Witnesses** — called by a side, or by neither.
 * - **Support people** — the juniors and clerks who work under an advocate on
 *   record. A junior is access delegation, not a party, which is why they are
 *   a population of their own and never a litigant.
 *
 * **The relationships live on the participant now.** An earlier build drew
 * them as edges on a map; the master-detail browser answers them where the
 * reader already is — an entity's detail names its representative and the
 * officers in charge of it, an officer's detail names the entity their
 * liability derives from, and a litigant's detail names their PoA-holder. The
 * §141 facts are the same facts; only where they are stated moved.
 *
 * **Side is a field, never a prefix.** An earlier build read the side off the
 * witness number — `PW-` meant complainant, `DW-` meant accused, anything else
 * fell into an "unassigned" bucket. That is a string doing a data model's job:
 * a court witness landed in "unassigned" rather than "neither party", and a
 * witness whose number had not been assigned yet had no side at all. `side`,
 * `numberPrefix` and `numberIndex` are now three authored fields, and
 * `assertWitnessNumbering` fails loudly when the prefix and the side disagree
 * rather than letting one quietly overrule the other.
 *
 * **Authored, then cross-checked.** Party type, designation, entity links,
 * PoA-holders, party-in-person status, legal-team staff and witnesses come
 * from `parties-dummy.json` — none of it is inferable from a cause title. What
 * the fixture record already knows stays the fixture's: the cause-title names
 * come from `record.parties` and the advocates on record from `record.counsel`,
 * so the section cannot name a party or an advocate that the case header does
 * not. Every join between the two throws instead of degrading, because a
 * parties screen that quietly drops an accused is worse than one that fails to
 * render.
