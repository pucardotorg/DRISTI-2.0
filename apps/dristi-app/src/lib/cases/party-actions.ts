 *
 * One universal entry adds everyone (PM decision, Sept 1): what differs per
 * kind of person is the *nature* of the act, and the flows say so —
 *
 * - **Advocate** — a system action. No approval: the vakalatnama the parties
 *   sign IS the authority, so the advocate is on the case the moment it is on
 *   record (scenario 1).
 * - **Witness** — an application; the magistrate orders the addition
 *   (scenario 9). The existing witness flow already carries this.
 * - **PoA-holder** — an application; order required (scenarios 5–8).
 *
 * This module is deliberately client-safe: the dialogs are client components,
 * and importing from `parties.ts` would drag the whole authored fixture pack
 * into the browser bundle. So the party options come in as serialisable props
 * built by the server, and the one label map the dialogs need is restated
 * here rather than imported past the pack.

 * when they join (user's call, Sept 1 — the vakalatnama carries the
