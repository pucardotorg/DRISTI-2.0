/**
 * The bridge between the case world and the access world (owner, Sept 2).
 *
 * The access fixtures were authored against their own little docket, so a
 * case opened from Your Cases showed an impossible thing: the viewer
 * holding office access with nobody on the vakalatnama to have shared it.
 * This derives each case's real access list from the case's own record and
 * parties pack — the viewer's side's advocates on the nama, and the office
 * staff working under them — so "Who has access" always tells the story
 * the case file tells.
 *
 * Derived people are display-shaped `AccessPerson`s. Phones are stable
 * synthetics (the registry knows these people; the fixtures do not), and
 * removal of a derived row is the dialog's local state, since the access
 * store never held them.
