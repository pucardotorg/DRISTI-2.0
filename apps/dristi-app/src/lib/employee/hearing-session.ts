/**
 * What this sitting has done so far — which listing the bench has called, which it
 * has ended, and which it has passed over.
 *
 * It lives in a module rather than in a screen's state because Start hearing now
 * navigates: pressing it opens that matter's case overview, so the cause list
 * unmounts on the way there. Marks kept on the list would be gone by the time the
 * bench came back — the matter would read as scheduled again, could be called a
 * second time, and would re-lock the order composer that `canDraftOrder` opens once
 * a hearing is under way. A client module instance outlives client-side navigation
 * inside `/employee`, so the marks survive the trip. They do not survive a reload,
 * and are not meant to: see below.
 *
 * **Still not a court record.** This is the same bargain `lib/employee/hearings.ts`
 * already describes — Start, End and Pass over are screen actions. Nothing here is
 * filed, notified, or written back to anything, and a refresh forgets all of it.
 * Moving it out of a component changed how long a mark lives on one device; it
 * changed nothing about what a mark claims.
 *
 * Read it through `components/employee/use-hearing-session.ts`, never directly from
 * a render — the hook is what subscribes.
